Obviously not - there are of course much more venues in Germany than those contained in this list. Your GET request only yielded the first results page containing the first 20 out of several thousands of venues. Check the API documentation under the section Venue Search. How can you request the venues from the remaining results pages? Iterate over the results pages and perform GET requests for all venues in Germany. After each iteration, extract the seven variables name, city, postalCode, address, url, longitude, and latitude. Join the information in one large data frame. Print the first 10 rows and the shape of the resulting data frame. The resulting data frame should look something like this (note that the exact number of search results may have changed since this document has been last modified) (see pdf).\n",
